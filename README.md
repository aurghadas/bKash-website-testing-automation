# 🌐 bKash Website Testing Automation
This program is built using Python and uses Playwright as the testing framework. It automates the testing of different features on the bKash Developer Portal. The tests cover core functionalities like navigating pages, interacting with UI components, and verifying key sections of the website.

The test suite is designed to display success and failure messages in the terminal for each tested feature as a whole. Each test outputs:  
✅ A final summary message for each specific feature at the end of its execution.  
❌ Failure details for any assertion that does not pass.
